Port Vila is the capital and largest city of Vanuatu and is located on the island of Efate. The temperature ranges from 24-34 degrees in this tropical paradise.

If you're strolling the markets and decide to do something in the afternoon, you can visit a cultural village, jet ski across the harbour, hike, abseil down a waterfall, buggy ride through various terrains, and much more.

If you feel lazy, and want to try the food whilst mingling with the locals, the women at the city market can serve you a delicious lunch with banana, sweet potato, or maniok on the side for a taste of the local food at a low cost.There is something for everyone to do!
