Take a deep breath and relax...

Tropical breezes and the emerald waters of Erakor Lagoon transport you to a tropical paradise. The Erakor Lagoon Holiday House features lush gardens, a refreshing pool and direct lagoon access from the expansive, landscaped backyard.

Far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the town centre but close enough to enjoy all the benefits, the Erakor Lagoon Holiday House is less than 10 minutes from downtown Port Vila.

The Erakor Lagoon Holiday House is the perfect base for you to experience the beauty and natural wonder of Vanuatu.
